# final project 

this app is designed to assist parents to teach pre-kinder children to read. 

View my live project here: https://nickpgit.github.io/jsd-final-project/

the app aims to develop 'emergent reading'; the first stages of reading development, consisting of: 
1. identifying words that rhyme
2. counting the number of syllables in a word 
3. recognizing words with the same beginning sound
4. break a sentence into words
5. recognise and 'play with' the individual sounds in spoken words (phonemic awareness)
